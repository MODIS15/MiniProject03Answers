# MiniProject03Answers
Along with the documentation, submit the answer to the following questions.

1.Briefly explain your solution and why it works. 

2.What is the average-case, best-case, and worst-case space consumed at each Node?

3.What is the average-case, best-case and worst-case number and size of messages being sent as a result of 
  1.A PUT message from a client, and
  2.A successful GET message from a client (that is, a value is found and sent back.)
  3.An unsuccessful GET message from a client (that is, no value is found.)

4.Write a paragraph or two suggesting improvements to scalability that does not compromise your one-node-resiliency.

5.If your solution provides exactly one-node-resiliency, write a paragraph or two suggesting methods your one-node-resiliency can be expanded to n-node resiliency, assuming your network has time to reconfigure itself in between node failures.
